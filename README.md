## First Assignment: Language Modelling

### preparation

#### Tensorflow installation
https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

### concepts
- A language model can predict the probability of the next word in the sequence, based on the words already observed in the sequence.
- Neural network models are a preferred method for developing statistical language models because they can use a distributed representation where different words with similar meanings have similar representation and because they can use a large context of recently observed words when making predictions
